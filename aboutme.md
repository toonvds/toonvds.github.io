Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Toon Vanderschueren. I'm a PhD researcher in Business Economics at the KU Leuven and in Mathematics at the University of Antwerp, both in Belgium. I'm also a PhD fellow at the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO).

My research focuses on using machine learning to support decision-making in business. I'm interested in operational problems and applications such as fraud detection, credit scoring, maintenance optimization, etc. I have worked on:

- **Causal inference and prescriptive analytics**:
  learning the causal effect of an intervention from observational data to assist decision makers.
  
  
- **Decision-focused and cost-sensitive learning**:
  improving machine learning models by aligning their optimization to the decision-making context.
