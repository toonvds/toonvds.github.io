Hi! :wave: My name is Toon Vanderschueren. I'm a PhD researcher in Business Economics at the KU Leuven and in Mathematics at the University of Antwerp, both in Belgium. My research focuses on using machine learning to support decision-making in business. Broadly, I'm interested in two things:
- **Decision-focused learning**: aligning the optimization of machine learning algorithms to the decision-making context. For example, by integrating costs in the objective function.
- **Causal inference and prescriptive analytics**: learning the causal effects of possible interventions from observational data to improve decision-making.


### Cost-sensitive learning


### Causal inference
