Hi! My name is Toon Vanderschueren. I'm a PhD researcher in Business Economics at the KU Leuven and in Mathematics at the University of Antwerp, both in Belgium. My research focuses on using machine learning to support decision-making in business. I'm interested in solving operational problems using machine learning in application such as fraud detection, credit scoring, maintenance optimization, ... Broadly, I have worked on:
- **Causal inference and prescriptive analytics**: learning the causal effects of possible interventions from observational data to improve decision-making.
- **Decision-focused and cost-sensitive learning**: improve automated decisions by aligning the optimization of machine learning algorithms to the decision-making context.
