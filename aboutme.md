Hi! 👋 My name is Toon Vanderschueren. I'm a PhD researcher in Business Economics at the KU Leuven and in Mathematics at the University of Antwerp, both in Belgium. My research focuses on using machine learning to support decision-making in business. I'm interested in operational problems and applications such as fraud detection, credit scoring, maintenance optimization, etc. Broadly, I have worked on:
</p>
- **Causal inference and prescriptive analytics**
  Learning the causal effects of possible interventions from observational data to improve decision-making.
  
  
- **Decision-focused and cost-sensitive learning**:
  Improving machine learning models by aligning their optimization to the decision-making context.
